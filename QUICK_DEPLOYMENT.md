Your Flask blog application has been successfully prepared for deployment. Here's what you need to do:

## 📋 What's Been Set Up

✅ **Git Repository**: Initialized and committed all files  
✅ **Deployment Files**: Created all necessary configuration files

## 📝 Step-by-Step Deployment Instructions

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com)
2. Click "New repository"
3. Name it: `personal-blog`
4. Make it **Public** (required for free deployment)
5. Don't initialize with README (we already have one)

### Step 2: Push to GitHub
```bash
# Add GitHub as remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/personal-blog.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin master
```

### Step 3: Deploy on Render
1. Go to [render.com](https://render.com)
2. Sign up with your GitHub account
3. Click "New +" → "Web Service"
4. Connect your GitHub repository
5. Select your `personal-blog` repository
6. Configure:
   - **Name**: `personal-blog`
   - **Environment**: `Python 3`
   - **Build Command**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - **Start Command**: `gunicorn app:app`
   - **Plan**: Free
7. Click "Create Web Service"

### Step 4: Wait for Deployment
- Render will automatically build and deploy your app
- This usually takes 5-10 minutes
- You'll get a URL like: `https://your-app-name.onrender.com`

## 🔑 Important Notes

### Admin Credentials

3. **Create Some Posts**: Add content to showcase
